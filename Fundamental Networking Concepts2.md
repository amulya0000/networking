# Detailed Networking Concepts & Definitions

## Fundamental Networking Concepts

### Network
**Definition**: A collection of computers, servers, and devices that are connected together to share resources and communicate.

### Protocol
**Definition**: A set of rules and procedures that govern how data is transmitted between devices in a network.

### Data Packet
**Definition**: A unit of data formatted for transmission across a network, containing both the data payload and control information.

## Network Topologies

### BUS Topology
**Definition**: A network architecture where all devices are connected to a single central cable (backbone).

**Key Characteristics**:
- Linear connection
- Terminators at both ends
- Uses T-connectors for device attachment

**Real-world Example**: Early Ethernet networks using coaxial cable

### RING Topology
**Definition**: A network where each device connects to exactly two other devices, forming a circular path.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Unidirectional data flow
- Token-based access control
- Each device acts as a repeater

**Real-world Example**: IBM Token Ring networks, FDDI networks

### STAR Topology
**Definition**: A network configuration where all devices connect to a central hub or switch.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Centralized management
- Point-to-point connections
- Easy fault isolation

**Real-world Example**: Modern Ethernet LANs with switches

### TREE Topology
**Definition**: A hierarchical network structure combining characteristics of bus and star topologies.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Root node at top
- Lower levels branch out
- Parent-child relationship

**Real-world Example**: Large corporate networks with departments

### MESH Topology
**Definition**: A network where devices are interconnected with multiple paths between nodes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Redundant connections
- Self-healing capability
- High reliability

**Real-world Example**: Internet backbone, wireless mesh networks
